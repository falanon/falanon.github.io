### CPSC 120

* Lab 12: Making Our First Animation

    Lab 12, part 2 fascinated me with its animated gradient challenge.
    Exploring GIF animation and the role of RGB color channels, especially
    using the sin() function for dynamic color transitions, was captivating.
    Building a sine lookup table and applying modulo arithmetic provided
    hands-on experience in programmatically manipulating images. This lab
    not only enhanced my image processing skills but also demonstrated
    programming's visual appeal, making it a standout project for me.

* Lab 4: Hi-Lo Game

    Lab 4, part 2 offered an engaging high/low guessing game project,
    fostering problem-solving and coding creativity. Designing logical
    structures, utilizing if statements, and incorporating user feedback
    contributed to a well-rounded learning experience. The Makefile structure
    deepened understanding of project organization, compilation processes,
    and coding standards. This lab significantly bolstered my C++ skills and
    aid the groundwork for tackling more intricate programming challenges ahead.

* Lab 5: Decimal Feet to Feet & Inches
  
    Lab 5, part 2 explores converting decimal feet to feet, inches, and eighths,
    enhancing our grasp of floating-point numbers and integer operations. With a
    focus on real-world applications for woodworking, precision is crucial, making
    it a practical coding challenge. The lab promotes a methodical problem-solving
    approach, stressing careful planning, iterative coding, and early error detection
    through frequent compilation. Introduction of make targets, lint checks, and
    format checks instills good programming practices.
